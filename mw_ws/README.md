# MathWorks' ROS and Gazebo

Mathworks' virtual machine is not well configured, so I extracted the necessnary files out so you can run in your own ROS environment.

Some useful link:

![Get Started with Gazebo and Simulated TurtleBot](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-gazebo-and-a-simulated-turtlebot.html)

Very hard to use and just for the world files have to download whole virtual machine. Mathworks should release the world they use and other source codes for us ROS user.

Remeber to specify the model in .bashrc:

```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
```
